## Future Scope

1. **Token Redemption**:

   - Implement a system for investors to redeem or trade their earned tokens for benefits or certifications.

2. **Project Impact Tracking**:

   - Add functionality to track the environmental impact of each project and showcase the contribution of each investor.

3. **Multi-Project Support**:
   - Allow users to invest in multiple carbon offset projects, diversifying their contributions and rewards.

The **CarbonOffset** contract provides a decentralized, transparent, and incentivized platform for supporting carbon offset projects, driving environmental sustainability.
